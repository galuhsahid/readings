# readings

This repository hosts the papers/articles that I've read. I mostly read papers/articles about data though I cannot promise to not read other things too :) 

The pdfs that I uploaded here are all annotated - however these are my personal annotations so they might be unreadable. I'll always link to the original post/paper in case you want to check it out yourself (you should!).
