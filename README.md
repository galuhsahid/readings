# readings

This repository hosts the papers/articles that I've read. I mostly read papers/articles about data though I cannot promise to not read other things too :) 

The pdfs that I uploaded here are all annotated - however these are my personal annotations so they might be unreadable. I'll always link to the original post/paper in case you want to check it out yourself (you should!).

## General
- 150 Successful Machine Learning Models: 6 Lessons Learned at Booking.com [(annotated pdf)](bernardi-booking.pdf) [(paper)](https://www.kdd.org/kdd2019/accepted-papers/view/150-successful-machine-learning-models-6-lessons-learned-at-booking.com)
- Classifier calibration [(annotated pdf)](poulopoulos-calibration.pdf) [(article)](https://towardsdatascience.com/classifier-calibration-7d0be1e05452)
- On Being a Data Skeptic [(annotated pdf)](oneil-data_skeptic.pdf) [(article)](https://www.oreilly.com/content/on-being-a-data-skeptic/): a timeless read. This is from 2013 but many, if not all points, are still relevant today. A mandatory reading for all data practicioners IMO.
- Software 2.0 [(annotated pdf)](karpathy-software.pdf) [(article)](https://medium.com/@karpathy/software-2-0-a64152b37c35): This essay explores what Karpathy names "Software 2.0"; in contrast to Software 1.0, where humans write explicit instructions to the computer, in Software 2.0 we "specify some goal on the behavior of a desirable program". By this definition, things like neural networks are considered as Software 2.0 & not just a tool. This essay also explores the limitations of Software 2.0, including interpretability, bias, & adversarial attack.
- The End of Moore's Law, CPUs (as we know them), and the Rise of Domain Specific Architectures [(annotated pdf)](hennessy-dsa.pdf) [(slides)](https://www.kisacoresearch.com/sites/default/files/presentations/09.00_-_alphabet_-_john_hennessy.pdf): I read this to better understand the paper *The Hardware Lottery*. This slide deck explains why we're moving towards Domain Specific Architectures---the downfall of Moore's Law being one of the reasons.
- The Hardware Lottery [(annotated pdf)](hooker-hw_lottery.pdf) [(paper)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.06489): this paper discusses that throughout history, hardware & software have frequently determined which research ideas succeed. This is even more worrisome when we take into account the fact that we're moving towards Domain Specific Architectures (DSA); the implication would be that some research directions (the ones with DSAs available/DSAs that are commercially viable) will prevail while other research directions that have potential (& can even possibly be better given the chance), yet are not supported by existing DSAs might be left behind.
- Whatâ€™s Keeping Women Out of Data Science? [(annotated pdf)](bcg-women_ds.pdf) [(article)](https://www.bcg.com/en-us/publications/2020/what-keeps-women-out-data-science): findings include a) women seek for clear information of what the day-to-day job is really like; b) women also seek for more opportunities with actual practicioners, because they're looking for a direct feel of the ways of working, degree of collaboration, personalities which cannot be conveyed through corporate slideshows. I think this further emphasizes why representation is very important.

## Metrics
- Categorizing Variants of Goodhart's Law [(annotated pdf)](manheim-garrabrant_goodharts.pdf) [(paper)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.04585)
- Designing and evaluating metrics [(annotated pdf)](taylor-design_eval_metrics.pdf) [(article)](https://medium.com/@seanjtaylor/designing-and-evaluating-metrics-5902ad6873bf)
- How do you set metrics? [(annotated pdf)](zhuo-how_to_set_metrics.pdf) [(article)](https://medium.com/the-year-of-the-looking-glass/how-do-you-set-metrics-59f78fea7e44)
- Metrics Versus Experience [(annotated pdf)](zhuo-metrics_exp.pdf) [(article)](https://medium.com/the-year-of-the-looking-glass/metrics-versus-experience-a9347d6b80b)


## NLP
- Abusive Language Detection in Online User Content [(annotated pdf)](nobata-abusive-lang-detection.pdf) [(paper)](http://www.yichang-cs.com/yahoo/WWW16_Abusivedetection.pdf)

- The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Recurrent Neural Networks [(annotated pdf)](karpathy-rnn.pdf) [(article)](http://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/)
- Multilingual Multi-class Sentiment Classification Using Convolutional Neural Networks [(annotated pdf)](attia-sentiment-cnn.pdf) [(paper)](https://research.google/pubs/pub46932/)
- NLP for supervised learning [(annotated pdf)](yan-nlp_for_supervised_learning.pdf) [(article)](https://eugeneyan.com/writing/nlp-supervised-learning-survey/)
